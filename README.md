### Project Description
The reverse thermometer visually shows temperature decreasing rather than increasing,often with a bar.
set warning sound also


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In air conditioning

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
we consider its principles, we might look at a similar concept involving a thermal expansion device that responds inversely to temperature changes.
